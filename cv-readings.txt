The automatic CV parsing extracts relevant information such as
name, address, skills and previous work experience from original
CVs (e. g. given as PDF or DOC documents) and transforms
them into a searchable semi-structured format.

The search engine indexes parsed CVs and enables searching
with semi-structured queries as well as through search facets
and tag clouds. CVs are assigned a relevance score w.r.t. the
query by the search engine and are ranked accordingly.

Automatic vacancy parsing extracts relevant information from

and other job-opening-related keywords.

The query generation component automatically generates semistructured
search queries for finding matching candidates in the
document collection.
